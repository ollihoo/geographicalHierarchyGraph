# GeographicalHierarchyGraph

This project plays around with geographical data. It uses attraction data that will be saved into
a Neo4j database. With this data it is possible to show a card with all attractions. There are also tools
to calculate distances between pois.

This application uses interfaces to OSM to parse data. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> -
